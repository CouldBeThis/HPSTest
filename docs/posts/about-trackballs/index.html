<p>The trackball was invented as part of a post-<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/World_War_II?lang=en">World War II</a>-era radar plotting system named <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Display_System?lang=en">Comprehensive Display System</a> (CDS) by <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Ralph_Benjamin?lang=en">Ralph Benjamin</a> when working for the British <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Royal_Navy?lang=en">Royal Navy</a> Scientific Service.[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Hill_2005_Benjamin-2">2]</a>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Copping_2013_Benjamin-3">3]</a> Benjamin&rsquo;s project used <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Analog_computer?lang=en">analog computers</a> to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Joystick?lang=en">joystick</a>. Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented a <em>ball tracker</em>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Hill_2005_Benjamin-2">2]</a>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Copping_2013_Benjamin-3">3]</a> system called the <em>roller ball</em>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Hill_2005_Benjamin-2">2]</a> for this purpose in 1946.[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Hill_2005_Benjamin-2">2]</a>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Copping_2013_Benjamin-3">3]</a> The device was patented in 1947,[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Hill_2005_Benjamin-2">2]</a> but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Copping_2013_Benjamin-3">3]</a> and the device was kept as a military secret.[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Copping_2013_Benjamin-3">3]</a> Production versions of the CDS used joysticks.</p>

<h2 id="cds">CDS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The CDS system had also been viewed by a number of engineers from <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Ferranti-Packard?lang=en">Ferranti Canada</a>, who returned to Canada and began development of the <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy?lang=en">Royal Canadian Navy&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/DATAR?lang=en">DATAR</a> system in 1952. Designed primarily by Tom Cranston, Fred Longstaff and <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Kenyon_Taylor?lang=en">Kenyon Taylor</a>, they chose the trackball as the primary input, using a standard <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Five-pin_bowling?lang=en">five-pin bowling</a> ball as the roller. DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin&rsquo;s display, but used a <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Digital_computer?lang=en">digital computer</a> to calculate tracks, and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation?lang=en">pulse-code modulation</a> radio signals.[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Vardalas_1994_DATAR-4">4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>DATAR&rsquo;s trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several additional rollers provided mechanical  support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of  output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the  physical movement of the ball could be determined.</p>
<p>Since 1966, the American company <em>Orbit Instrument Corporation</em> produced a device named <em>X-Y Ball Tracker</em>, a trackball, which was embedded into radar flight control desks.[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-B%C3%BClow_2009_Rollkugel-5">5]</a>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-6">6]</a></p>
<p>A similar trackball device at the German <strong><a href="https://wikiless.org/w/index.php?title=Bundesanstalt_f%C3%BCr_Flugsicherung&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1&amp;lang=en">Bundesanstalt für Flugsicherung</a> [<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Bundesanstalt_f%C3%BCr_Flugsicherung">de</a>]</strong> was constructed by a team around <a href="https://wikiless.org/w/index.php?title=Rainer_Mallebrein&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1&amp;lang=en">Rainer Mallebrein</a> [<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Rainer_Mallebrein">de</a>] of Telefunken <em>Konstanz</em> as part of the development for the <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Telefunken?lang=en">Telefunken</a> computer infrastructure around the main frame <a href="https://wikiless.org/w/index.php?title=Telefunken_TR_440&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1&amp;lang=en">TR 440</a> [<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/TR_440">de</a>], process computer <a href="https://wikiless.org/w/index.php?title=Telefunken_TR_86&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1&amp;lang=en">TR 86</a> and video terminal <a href="https://wikiless.org/w/index.php?title=Telefunken_SIG_100&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1&amp;lang=en">SIG 100-86</a>,[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-7">7]</a> which began in 1965.[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-B%C3%BClow_2009_Rollkugel-5">5]</a> This trackball was called <strong>Rollkugel</strong> (German for &ldquo;rolling ball&rdquo;). Somewhat later, the idea of &ldquo;reversing&rdquo; this device led to the introduction of the first computer <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Ball_mouse?lang=en">ball mouse</a> (still named <strong><a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Rollkugel_(mouse_device)?lang=en">Rollkugel</a></strong>, model <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/RKS_100-86?lang=en">RKS 100-86</a>), which was offered as an alternative input device to light pens and trackballs for Telefunken&rsquo;s computer systems since 1968.[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-B%C3%BClow_2009_Rollkugel-5">5]</a>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-OldMouse_Telefunken-8">8]</a>[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-Ebner_2018-9">9]</a></p>
<h2 id="later-trackballs">Later trackballs</h2>
<p>In later trackball models the electrical contacts were replaced  by a &ldquo;chopper wheel&rdquo; which had small slots cut into it in the same  locations as the contacts. An LED shone light through the slots to an  optical sensor, As the disk rotated the slots alternately lined up and  then blocked the light from the LED, causing pulses to be produced in  the sensor. The operation was otherwise similar.</p>
<p>Mice used the same basic system for determining motion, but had the problem that the ball was in contact with the desk or <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Mousepad?lang=en">mousepad</a>. In order to provide smooth motion the balls were often covered with an  anti-slip surface treatment, which was, by design, sticky. Rolling the  mouse tended to pick up any dirt and drag it into the system where it  would clog the chopper wheels, demanding cleanup. In contrast the  trackball is in contact only with the user&rsquo;s hand, which tends to be  cleaner. In the late 1990s both mice and trackballs began using direct  optical tracking which follows dots on the ball, avoiding the need for  anti-slip surface treatment.</p>
<p>As with modern mice, most trackballs now have an auxiliary device primarily intended for scrolling. Some have a <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Scroll_wheel?lang=en">scroll wheel</a> like most mice, but the most common type is a “scroll ring” which is  spun around the ball. Kensington&rsquo;s SlimBlade Trackball similarly tracks  the ball itself in three dimensions for scrolling.</p>
<h2 id="2013-onwards">2013 onwards</h2>
<p>As of 2013 and into the 2020s, two major companies produce consumer trackballs, <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Logitech?lang=en">Logitech</a> and <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/ACCO_Brands?lang=en">Kensington</a>, although Logitech has narrowed its product line to two models. Other  smaller companies occasionally offer a trackball in their product line. <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Microsoft?lang=en">Microsoft</a> produced popular models including The Microsoft Trackball Explorer, but has since discontinued all of its products.</p>
<p>In September 2017 Logitech announced release of MX-Ergo Mouse,[<a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Trackball#cite_note-techscoop.in-10">10]</a> which was released after 6 years of its last trackball mouse.</p>
